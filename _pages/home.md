<div style='max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;'>I am a college student with a passion for learning new skills and an appreciation for a hard day's work. I hope to complete my degree in Computer Science and Modern Languages in the Spring of 2017, after which I hope to pursue a Master's Degree at either the University of Amsterdam or the University of Rotterdam.</div>
