# Hello World!

*Okay, it's cliché, I know, but you've got to start somewhere, right?*

In any case, welcome!

### Who am I?

My name is Dylan, and I'm a recent graduate of Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, TX, and a full-time web developer for Robert Half Technology's Salaried Professional Service.

I speak English and French fluently, and am currently learning Dutch as well.

I love all things tech, and when I'm not at work or working on side projects, I spend my time catching up on the extensive reading list that built up during my college career.

### What is this?

To be honest, I'm not really sure... Informal resumé? Blog? Monument to narcissism?

Probably all of the above. Well, hopefully not so much that last one. It's difficult to create a resumé without sounding overly fond of yourself, since the entire point is to flaunt your credentials, but I'd like to think I've struck a decent balance.

To be totally honest, I just like playing around and building stuff. And this website is basically just the result of my owning a domain name, and wanting to fiddle with new frameworks and languages. If it doesn't seem very formal, that's because *it was never meant to be*. If I really just wanted an online resume, I could've just redirected this domain to a Google Doc.

This site exists for no other reason than it can.
