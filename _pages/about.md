## Overview

I am a college student with a passion for learning new skills and an appreciation for a hard day's work. I hope to complete my degree in Computer Science and Modern Languages in the Spring of 2017, after which I hope to pursue a Master's Degree at either the University of Amsterdam or the University of Rotterdam.

## Languages

I am currently [C1 fluent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels) (Effective Operational Proficiency) in French.

I am also teaching myself Dutch in my free time, and hope to reach [B2 fluency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels) by graduation.
