## Overview

I currently attend classes at Stephen F. Austin State University. I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree with a double major in Computer Science and Modern Languages (French specialization), and a minor in International Business. I expect to graduate in May 2017.

My GPA is currently 3.677

I am currently the secretary of my university's Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE) chapter, and have formerly occupied the position of secretary and president for the university's French Club.

I am also a member of the School of Honors and the President's List, and a recipient of the SFA STEM Scholarship.
