## Elliott Electric Supply  
**Part-Time Web Developer**  
*Nacogdoches, TX &bull; 2016-Present*

As a part-time web developer, I supplement my full-time course load with approximately 20 hours per week working on various bug fixes and new features to the company websites, picking up valuable skills in the process.

**Accomplishments**

- Quickly learned ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC on the job, with very little prior exposure to the platform.
- Was able to track particularly difficult bugs with very little prior knowledge of the applications in question; described as “extremely impressive” by my Assistant Team Lead.
- Am currently in the process of migrating the Web Team’s projects from their TFS XAML builds to the newer TFS Build format.


## University Projects

### Compiler Project (Organization of Programming Languages)  
&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/Kujawadl/CSC442_Proj2"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> Github</a>

The compiler project was a two-part lab (only the second iteration is hosted on GitHub) wherein we created a language and specified a context-free grammar, based on a simple description of the language requirements given to us. From there, we implemented a simple interpreter in two parts:

- the scanner, which reads the input programs and returns a sequence of tokens
- the parser, which reads the tokens, and runs the code line by line, generating an error list if necessary

### Operating System Labs  
&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/Kujawadl/CSC_341_OS_Lab"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> Github</a>

This was a 5-part assignment spanning the duration of the semester wherein various topics relevant to operating system design were explored. Topics for each lab were:

1. Machine/Operating System Overview
2. Concurrency/Multiprogramming
3. Virtual Memory/Paging
4. Process Scheduling
5. File Management

To implement these labs, we had to build a simple virtual hardware program, based on the professor's specifications, and then build a simple operating system to run on top of our "hardware." The operating system itself was implemented in the higher-level language as well, though the hardware system does include an ISA, "memory" (16-bit words, 256 words of memory total), and a "hard disk." Thus, users of the operating system may run programs that actually do execute on the "hardware" system, not directly in the higher-level language.

The GitHub repository has all five versions of the lab, with each version saved as its own release, including all source code and the a copy of the actual report submitted for grading.
